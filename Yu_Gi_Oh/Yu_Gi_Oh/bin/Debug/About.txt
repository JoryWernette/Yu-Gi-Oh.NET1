I decided to make a sort of Yu-Gi-Oh database for my final project. The goal was to have a list of cards and to have another window open when a card is clicked. I have succeeded in this. I would like to continue to make other functions work, like the banlist. 
I saved the current banlist to a csv and began making a form for it to be read to when the button is pressed from the other forms, but could not get it working in time for the due date, though I feel like I have all of the pieces and can put it all together. 
I would also like to have a deck saving functionality. I can easily populated the source filed in carddata and would like to be able to assign decks a list of cards and be able to give a list of what decks are saved and their respective cards. Much like the banlist, I feel like I have the pieces and just could not get a working version in time. 
I knew I needed to work on one functionality completely before moving on to the next, but I could not get them working and I feel like I do learn from trying other things to get the first task accomplished, so I am still learning.
I do feel accomplished with having this little form working and it looks very much like my initial sketches I made from when we were still in class. One thing I would like to improve on the current way that I am listing the cards is if I could  get a drop down menu for the column headers of the listview box. I would like to be able to refine searches based on the attribute, types, attacks and such and have the list refresh to show results that fit.
Another thing I was trying with this project, was to connect this form to my Relational Database class final project. I made a MySQL database that has the search functionality that I am looking for with nearly all of the cards in the first yugioh set included. Figuring this out began to prove more difficult than I thought and then I was told that is what we will cover next semester in Java II, so I resorted to a more trivial way with the csv and txt files.

All in all, I like my project and I had a good time working on it. I wish I could have gotten more of the functions working as I had hoped for, but I was getting way ahead of myself. I intend to continue work over the summer break both to improve my project and to keep learning. I want to be as prepared for .NET II as I can be.
